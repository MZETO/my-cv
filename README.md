# my-cv

This is my actual CV, made with the following stack...

- React 18
- vanilla CS3
- ES6 features

To create this project, I used the template from this repo --> https://github.com/MZETO/react-project-template

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\

### `npm lint`

Launches lint errors diagnosis in the console.

### `npm lint-fix`

Fix all fixable lint errors showed in console.

### `npm format`

Fix all typo, identation, etc... errors in auto mode.

I recommend to use VS code extension to extend some features.
